# Construct-Binary-Tree-from-Inorder-and-Postorder-Traversal
Given two integer arrays inorder and postorder where inorder is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, we can construct the binary tree using the following steps:

Find the root node of the binary tree from the postorder array. Since the last element of postorder is always the root node of the binary tree, we can extract it and set it as the root node of the tree.
Locate the position of the root node in the inorder array. This will allow us to determine the left and right subtrees of the root node.
Recursively construct the left and right subtrees of the root node by performing steps 1-2 on each subtree using the appropriate portions of the inorder and postorder arrays.
## The steps to construct the binary tree from inorder and postorder traversals are as follows:

Find the root node of the binary tree from the postorder traversal. Since the last element of the postorder traversal is always the root node of the binary tree, we can extract it and set it as the root node of the tree.
Locate the position of the root node in the inorder traversal. This will allow us to determine the left and right subtrees of the root node.
Recursively construct the left and right subtrees of the root node by performing steps 1-2 on each subtree using the appropriate portions of the inorder and postorder traversals.
By following these steps, we can construct the binary tree from the inorder and postorder traversals. This technique is useful in various computer science applications, such as in compilers, programming language processors, and database indexing.
